    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression objective function. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, which encourages the model to have smaller coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, the objective function is modified to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values, subject to a constraint that limits the size of the coefficients. This constraint is expressed as the L2 norm of the coefficient vector, which is added to the objective function as a penalty term. The strength of the penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called Î» (lambda), which determines how much weight is given to the penalty term relative to the sum of squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and OLS regression is that Ridge Regression adds a regularization term to the objective function, while OLS regression does not. This regularization term helps to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, which reduces their variance and makes them less sensitive to small changes in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Ridge Regression differs from OLS regression in that it adds a regularization term that penalizes large coefficients, which helps to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance."

    "The assumptions of Ridge Regression are similar to those of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. These assumptions include:\n",

    "Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear.\n",
    "Independence: Ridge Regression assumes that the observations in the dataset are independent of each other.\n",

    "The value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression can be selected using a technique called cross-validation.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to cross-validation in Ridge Regression is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds.

The average performance across all k folds is then used to evaluate the model.\n",

    "Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection. The Ridge Regression model includes a regularization parameter, lambda, which controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients of the independent variables. As lambda increases, the coefficients are shrunk towards zero, effectively reducing the impact of less important variables on the model.\n",

    "By setting lambda to an appropriate value, Ridge Regression can be used to identify and select the most important features in a dataset. Specifically, features with non-zero coefficients in the Ridge Regression model are considered to be important predictors of the dependent variable, while features with zero coefficients are considered to be less important or irrelevant.\n",

    "Another approach is to use a variant of Ridge Regression called Lasso Regression, which includes an additional penalty term that encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates.
